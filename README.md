# DX Cop

#### Static analysis for your Saleforce git repo

Keep your Salesforce DX git repository clean and free of potential deployment problems. For example: added a new picklist field, but forgot to commit the updates to record types? DX Cop will remind you. 

Right now, all you'll find here is a Typescript script or two, to perform various checks over a Salesforce DX project. Soon to become a plugin for the SFDX CLI.
