## [0.0.3] - 2022-04-03

Add checks for Email-to-Case settings.

## [0.0.2] - 2022-03-22

- Add some very basic log output as checks occur
- Expand the README, including current limitations

While this release introduces only minor changes to functionality, it represents an almost complete rewrite! The new class structure is far better suited for expansion going forward.

## [0.0.1] - 2022-03-14

First ever published version! Contains some basic checks over LWCs and Record Types.
